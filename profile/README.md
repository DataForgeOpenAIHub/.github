## Repositories Overview

### 1. End-to-End Data Pipeline: Steam Sales Analysis [Steam-Sales-Analysis] 🎮

This repository implements an end-to-end ETL pipeline for analyzing Steam sales data. It retrieves, processes, and stores gaming metadata and sales data, offering insightful trends and performance analysis.

- **ETL Pipeline**: Automates the retrieval, validation, and processing of data from SteamSpy and Steam APIs.
- **Data Storage**: Stored in a MySQL database hosted on Aiven Cloud.
- **Visualization**: Interactive Tableau dashboards provide insights into gaming trends.
- **Automation**: Fully automated using CLI-based orchestration.
- **Open-source contribution**: Deployed and maintained a [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/steamstore-etl/) package/library (open-source contribution).

📂 **Technologies Used**: Python, MySQL, Tableau, Steam API, Typer CLI, ETL
